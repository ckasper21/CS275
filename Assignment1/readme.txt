Javascript functions:
- Fib(): computes and stores the Fibonacci Sequence to the n-th term in an fib_array
- createFibTable: generates a table for the Fib() outputs

How to run:
- Open cdc75_HW1.html with any web browser of your choosing.
- To run the Fibonacci calculator, enter a positive integer (not 0) into the
    designated textbox, and then hit the "Calculate" button.

Notes:
- The calculator will return error messages if a non-positive number is entered.
- Any decimal entered will also be rounded down to the nearest integer (due
    to parseInt).
